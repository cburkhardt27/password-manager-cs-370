# Password Manager (a CS 370 Project)
Presented by the Password People - a locally-hosted, containerized, sql-based password manager.

This main branch provides the download executable versions of our code. They include:
1) a DMG file for MacOS
2) an executable for Windows OS

Please refer to the branches 'windows' and 'mac_download' for the most current working editions of our codebase. These codebases are nearly identical, but they rely on different Python environment variables due to OS differences and have different configuration settings in the front end in order to make the application run properly on each operating system. The differences and setup instructionsa are documented in each branch.

Other branches on this repo represent prior iterations of the codebase. Unless you're interested in history for posterity's sake, you should ignore them. (If're you're trying to track version history of this project, you can also refer to this [github repistory]([url](https://github.com/michi-okahata/toy-password-manager)) for intermediate stages of development. The repository was a spike, and eventually it was integrated back into this repo because the spike worked better than the original product :) ).
